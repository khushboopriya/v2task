# v2task
Created with CodeSandbox

I have implemented a multi select search box.

For approaching , i first created the main page and then a button with state values for text as heading and a simple dialog with some demo text.
second, I used autocomplete grouped and select of material ui with no relation.
third I added a button which will be enabled only is both has some selected value.
fourth i tried sending them to main page with some global data array
and lastly I used a state for that global array and combined all.
